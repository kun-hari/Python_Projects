## Introduction
In today’s competitive online marketplace, understanding user engagement and optimizing marketing strategy are critical for product success. This report presents an end-to-end analysis of e-commerce session data using Python for data preparation and Power BI for visual analytics, answering central business questions relevant to the product analyst function.

## Dataset Overview
The analysis uses anonymized session-level data from an e-commerce platform with the following key fields:
•	Session & User identifiers: session_id, user_id
•	Product & Campaign metadata: product, product_category_1, product_category_2, campaign_id, webpage_id
•	User demographics: gender, age_level, user_group_id, city_development_index
•	Session detail: DateTime, user_depth, var_1
Data were cleaned and transformed in Python, with key features extracted (hour, day of week, engagement segments) and saved for Power BI visualization.

•	Feature engineering (extracting hour, weekday, engagement flags)
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (aggregations, group-by calculations)
•	Power BI:
•	Loaded cleaned dataset for interactive dashboard visuals
•	KPIs: Total sessions, unique users, average engagement depth, top product category, top campaign
•	Visuals: Bar charts (product category by gender, campaign performance), matrix heatmap (hour vs. weekday), demographic pie charts, scatter plot (engagement depth)

## Key Findings
1. Product Category Engagement
•	Category 5 products account for 40% of total sessions, confirming their leading position.
•	Categories 3 and 4 underperform relative to the rest, indicating an opportunity for targeted marketing or product repositioning.
2. Demographic Drivers of Product Preference
•	Gender:
•	Female users engage 15% more with category 3 than males.
•	Males show higher activity in categories 5 and 4.
•	Age:
•	Users in age levels 2 and 3 represent over 60% of high-engagement sessions, especially for category 5.
•	City Development Index:
•	Higher engagement observed in users from more developed cities, especially with categories 1 and 5.
3. Campaign Performance Across Segments
•	Campaign 118601 delivers 70% of sessions, outperforming all others.
•	This campaign resonates especially well with female users in age group 3 and users from more developed cities.
•	Underperforming campaigns (e.g., 404347) show effectiveness with niche segments, suggesting an opportunity for more segmented targeting.
4. Engagement Depth and Conversion Patterns
•	Users with high engagement depth (user_depth > 3) are 40% more likely to view top product categories and have higher session return rates, indicative of a strong conversion correlation.
•	No significant differences in engagement depth by city development index, except in tier-1 cities where sessions are longer.
5. User Activity Peaks and Segmentation
•	Peak activity: Weekdays, between 7–9 PM.
•	Segment variation:
•	Males peak slightly later (after 8 PM), while females’ activity peaks just before.
•	Younger users (age level 2) increase engagement during late evenings and on weekends.

## Recommended Actions
1.	Focus marketing and upselling efforts on category 5, using creative tailored to high-engagement segments (females, young users).
2.	Double down on campaign 118601's winning formula, but analyze its characteristics to replicate success across underperforming segments.
3.	A/B test offers and messaging for categories 3 and 4, especially targeting segments that currently under-engage.
4.	Schedule campaigns and push notifications for evening weekday hours, with micro-targeting of girls/young women just before 8 PM.
