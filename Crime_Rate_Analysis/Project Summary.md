Analyzed 1,000 crime-incident records across ten U.S. states. Texas (TX) and California (CA) account for almost 60 % of all events. Houston, Dallas, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago are the five hottest spots. Burglary and Domestic Violence are tied as the most frequent crime types. Victims are on average 52 years old, with a fairly wide spread.



Key Findings

* Highest-crime cities: Houston = Dallas > New York > Los Angeles > Chicago.
* Highest-crime states: TX > CA > NY > IL > PA.
* Most common offenses: Burglary \& Domestic Violence (â‰ˆ12 % each), followed by Homicide \& Robbery.
* Average victim age: 52 years (distribution is slightly right-skewed; victims range from teenagers to elders).
* Gender \& race distributions (not shown) reveal that males and minorities are slightly over-represented among victims.



Suggested Actions

1. Resource allocation

* Prioritize patrols and community programs in Houston, Dallas, and Los Angeles.
* Fund burglary-prevention initiatives (e.g., subsidized home security) and domestic-violence outreach.



2\. Targeted prevention

* Use neighborhood watch and smart-lighting grants in the worst burglary blocks.
* Partner with local NGOs for victim-support groups focused on middle-aged populations (largest victim segment).



3\. Data-driven policing

* Deploy predictive policing models using this dataset plus real-time 911 feeds to anticipate burglary spikes.
* Monitor success metrics (incident counts per 10 k residents) quarterly and re-balance resources accordingly.



4\. Community engagement

* Organize town-hall meetings in the top five cities to co-design crime-reduction strategies.
* Launch public awareness campaigns on domestic-violence hotlines and safe-house locations.
